# PSBridge

psbridge is an experimental compatibility and recompilation project focused on bringing psp software to the playstation 2.

instead of emulating the psp cpu instruction-by-instruction, psbridge aims to translate psp allegrex code into code that can run on the playstation 2's r5900 processor, while providing the compatibility needed for psp software to run on ps2 hardware.

> this project is still experimental and is not intended to provide full psp compatibility yet.

## How it works

the general idea is:

```text
psp executable
     ↓
analysis
     ↓
allegrex → r5900 recompilation
     ↓
psbridge runtime
     ↓
playstation 2 elf
```

psbridge tries to avoid running a complete virtual psp cpu.

whenever possible, psp code is translated ahead of time into native ps2 code.

some parts may still require runtime handling depending on how the original software behaves.

## Main goals

* recompile allegrex code to r5900
* provide a compatibility layer between psp and ps2
* reuse the original game data and resources
* produce native ps2 elf executables
* keep runtime overhead as low as possible
* make porting psp software to the ps2 easier

## Project status

psbridge is currently in an early experimental stage.

large parts of the project are still being designed, implemented, and tested.

compatibility, performance, and accuracy are not guaranteed.

things will probably change a lot during development.
